BASIC-1965

This is an interpreter for the oldest form of BASIC, Dartmouth BASIC. Created in 1967 by Kemeny and Kurtz, BASIC was an interactive language that could take advantage of timesharing systems.

This version is a primitive form of BASIC, less powerful than Microsoft BASIC.

- The statements supported are REM, LET, READ, DATA, PRINT, INPUT, IF, GOTO, FOR, and NEXT.
- The LET statement must include the LET keyword.
- Only one statement on each line.
- No support for MAT statements.
- No file operations.
- No IF/THEN/ELSE. IF/THEN is supported, and that only with a target line number, not a target statement.
- No user-defined functions.
