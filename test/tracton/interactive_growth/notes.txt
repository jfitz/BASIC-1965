The interactive growth program listed in the text produces output different from the output in the text.

I reverse-engineered the formulas for growth (births and deaths) and found a solution that comes close to the specified output. The revised program has the name 'interactive_growth_fixed.bas'. It contains comments and simpler calculations.
