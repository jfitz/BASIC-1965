BASIC IS A SIMPLE LANGUAGE. IT ENABLES ONE TO DESCRIBE
PROGRAMS TO THE COMPUTER WITH LITTLE LEARNING EFFORT.
THIS PROGRAM WILL TRY TO TEACH YOU HOW TO PROGRAM IN BASIC.


BEFORE WE CAN HAVE THE COMPUTER WORK WITH DATA, WE MUST HAVE
THE DATA READ WITH A -----STATEMENT. 
(1. READ  2. PRINT  3. DATA  4. NONE OF THESE.)
YOUR ANSWER? 3
INCORRECT. CORRECT ANSWER IS  1
LET'S TRY THAT ONE AGAIN.

YOUR ANSWER? 1
CORRECT


ALL DATA THAT IS READ IN USING A READ STATEMENT MUST APPEAR
IN SOME ----- STATEMENT.  (1. INPUT  2. PRINT  3. DATA
4. NONE OF THESE.)
YOUR ANSWER? 3
CORRECT


TO PERFORM A COMPUTATION, WE HAVE A VARIABLE ON THE LEFT OF
THE EQUAL SIGN, AND A FORMULA ON THE RIGHT E.G., TO 
 ------ X = A + B   .  (1. COMPUTE  2. LET  3. VARIABLE
4. NONE OF THESE.)
YOUR ANSWER? 4
INCORRECT. CORRECT ANSWER IS  2

ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DOES NOT FOLLOW THE RULES. WHICH ONE?
(1. LET X = Y  2. LET Z = Z + 17  3. LET A + B = X )
YOUR ANSWER? 3
CORRECT


TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLE T BY X UNITS, WHICH OF
THE FOLLOWING DO WE USE?
(1. LET T = X + T  2. LET X = T + X  3. LET T - X = T )
YOUR ANSWER? 1
CORRECT


YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR FIRST COURSE IN BASIC.
CONGRATULATIONS.
